    <h1>Current Model Analysis</h1>

      <p>
        Considering the model currently proposed by your community's school district will help you cultivate a stronger argument for your own model that you are creating. When considering the model, look at it in terms of the school board's goals and criteria.
      </p>

      <h3>Evaluating the Existing Proposal</h3>

        <p>When considering the existing model being proposed by your school district, it is most important to evaluate it in with the criteria and goals given by the school district. For example, during a school redistricting process in a community outside of Atlanta, Georgia the school board proposed a school redistricting plan that, to parents, looked like the school board rewrote the district lines from scratch. The district lines were seemlingly incoherent (like gerrymandering) and had no regard for existing neighborhoods, which are very tightly knit in this area. When asked by parents, the school board stated that their main reason for redistricting was cost savings, which lead to the distorted district maps.</p>

        <p>Because cost savings were so important to the school board, the parent group creating the alternative district maps requested the cost saving information being used by the county so they could include that into their own plan, and refer to it when presenting the final plan to the school district. </p>

        <p>The lesson to be learned from this, and the one that can be applied to all efforts, is if the school board has a main goal in mind, incorporate this into your own goals and criteria so that your plan will be viewed as a strong alternative. In addition, when evaluating your community's existing proposal, if it does not make any sense, like with the above mentioned community, take these things that do not make sense, like disregard for existing neighborhoods, and incorporate them into your goals and criteria (ex. Critieria: keep existing neighborhoods intact).</p>
